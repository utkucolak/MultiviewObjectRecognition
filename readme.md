# Multiview Object Detection

Multiview Object Detection is a project aimed at detecting objects from multiple viewpoints using advanced computer vision techniques. This repository contains the codebase, datasets, and documentation to help you get started.

## Features

- **Multiview Support**: Detect objects from multiple camera angles.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily integrate and train custom detection models.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex scenarios.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiviewObjectDetection.git
    cd MultiviewObjectDetection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the environment:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    - Configure any additional environment variables as needed.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
    - Place your images and annotations in the `data/` directory.
    - Follow the format specified in the [Dataset Guidelines](docs/dataset_guidelines.md).

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
    ```

3. Run inference:
    ```bash
    python infer.py --input data/test_images/ --output results/
    ```
